# auto-icheckin
 Automatic iCheckin to reduce the hassle of logging into the website to take attendance.  Made with Python Selenium.

 1. Declare USERNAME, PASSWORD & DRIVERPATH variables in a local .env file with own login details & chromedriver.exe file path
 2. Run the file in terminal with the command:
 ```python izoneLogin.py #####```
 Replace ##### with the 5-digit iCheckIn code

 After running the command, wait for the program to do its thing. It should take only 5-10 seconds.
